## Written Reflections:

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration?
   If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and
   problem solving process.

    - We began by thinking of possible Classes we would need to make the functioning game - taking inspiration from our
    Flashcards project. Once we had a general idea of needed Classes, we jumped right in to building the Game Class,
    knowing that the rest of our new Classes will interact with Game.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

   - We would continue to refactor our longer methods, creating helper methods to abstract some functionality.
     We would also research and figure out how to test the methods that generate random return value or require
     random input/terminal input. After that, we would continue to work on Iteration 4.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

   - Throughout this project, we used Tuple so we could both drive and navigate at the same time.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

   - We worked synchronously, so feedback was constant and live. We both shared opinions and thoughts about how
     to move forward at each step. In our DTR we established that we both preferred being told feedback directly
     and honestly, and we stuck to that.
